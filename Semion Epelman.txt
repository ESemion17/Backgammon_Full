1) You failed to decouple the UI from logic, by introducing the 'Panel.PrintToConsole' method as a part of the logic assembly.
Do note that when implementing an engine, you should never couple it with a specific UI technology. This was also an explicit requirement.

2) You implemented a part of the game engine logic in the UI - the NextPlayer method should be invoked by the game engine itself,
whenever the current player is out of valid moves- it should not be up to the UI to decide this-
nor should the engine depend on the UI in order th properly function.

3)Unfortunately your game is not playable.. I could not get it to accept any move as legal.
You probably have some kind of bug in the system.

4)Overall - you have kept a clean and minimal design.

5)Clarity of code is an integral part of writing high quality software which stands the test of time.
You are definitely on your way there, but consider shortening methods, dividing long methods into shorter ones and giving them good names which describe what they do.
This will also make tracing bugs a lot easier since each method is small and well defined.
Exammple: 'GameEngine.IsLegalToMoveHome' is everything you should avoid.

6)Avoid magic numbers - constant integers in the code. this hinders readability.
